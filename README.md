# Tesla_Project
Aurdino fire alarm or fire detector using Flame sensor and Arduino board, the sensor basically detects IR (Infra Red) light wavelength between 760 nm â€“ 1100 nm (nano meter) that is emitted from fire flame. Most of the flame sensors came with YG1006 sensor which is a high speed and high sensitive NPN silicon photo transistor.

Following components are required for project designing:

-Aurdino-Uno Board
-Flame-Sensor
-LED
-Buzzer
-Breadboard
